# Pact message provider tests in C#

An example using `description` and `provider-states`

Execute tests with:

```
dotnet test
```

A file `pact.log` is created showing the sequence of execution during an interaction:

```
6/6/2025 6:25:22 PM: Description handler
6/6/2025 6:25:22 PM: State handler
6/6/2025 6:25:22 PM: WithContent
```
